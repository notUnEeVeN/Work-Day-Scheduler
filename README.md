# Tybalt Mallet's Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This is the Module 5 challenge for the fifth week of the UCB coding bootcamp. This week we were given the html and css of a daily planner, and were required to add some functionality to it using JavaScript, JQuery, and the dayjs library. The planner features a table with rows for each hour between 9 am to 5 pm. We were told to display a live clock on the top of the page, and have the rows display a certain color based on their relation to the current time, if the hour had past, the row has a gray background, the current hour has a red background, and the upcoming hours are in green.

## Usage 

This website can be used as a daily planner, you can input your hourly schedule, and get a quick reminder if you haven't completed it that time is running out! It can also be used as a way to study the basics of the concepts we learned this week such as dayjs and jquery, as well as a reminder of the JavaScript we will continue to work with in the future.
